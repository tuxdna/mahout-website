# Academic Use

* [Dicode](https://www.dicode-project.eu/)
 project uses Mahout's clustering and classification algorithms on top of
HBase.
* The course [Large Scale Data Analysis and Data Mining](http://www.dima.tu-berlin.de/menue/studium_und_lehre/aktuelles_semester_sommersemester_2011/aim_3_advanced_information_management)
 at [TU Berlin](http://www.tu-berlin.de/)
&nbsp;uses Mahout to teach students about the parallelization of data
mining problems with Hadoop and Map/Reduce
* Mahout is used at Carnegie Mellon University, as a comparable platform to [GraphLab](http://www.graphlab.ml.cmu.edu/)
.
* The [ROBUST project](http://www.robust-project.eu/)
, co-funded by the European Commission, employs Mahout in the large scale
analysis of online community data.
* Mahout is used for research and data processing at [Nagoya Institute of Technology](http://www.nitech.ac.jp/eng/schools/grad/cse.html)
, in the context of a large-scale citizen participation platform project,
funded by the Ministry of Interior of Japan.
* Several researches within [Digital Enterprise Research Institute](http://www.deri.ie)
 [NUI Galway](http://www.nuigalway.ie)
 use Mahout for e.g. topic mining and modelling of large corpora.
* We used Mahout in the NoTube EU project, and it saved a lot of time (and a brain transplant). The only piece we've used heavily in our apps ([http://vimeo.com/user3487770http://notube.tv/](http://vimeo.com/user3487770http://notube.tv/)
) so far is the Taste recommender, but I've been digging deeper into the
other components. I can't claim we're a hugely famous or successful
application, but I can say without doubt I don't regret using Mahout. It
did what it said it would do, and easily. One nice thing about this
community, is that Mahout is not
over-marketed. If the nature or scale of your problem better suits other
tools, the Mahout folk will tell you so.
