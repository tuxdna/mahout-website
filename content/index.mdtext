  <p>With scalable we mean:</p>
  <p>**Scalable to large data sets**. Our core algorithms for clustering, classfication and
    collaborative filtering are implemented on top of Apache Hadoop using the map/reduce paradigm. However we do not
    restrict contributions to Hadoop based implementations: Contributions that run on a single node or on a non-Hadoop
    cluster are welcome as well. The core libraries are highly optimized to allow for good performance also for
    non-distributed algorithms</p>
  <p>**Scalable to support your business case**. Mahout is distributed under a commercially friendly Apache Software
    license.</p>
  <p>**Scalable community**. The goal of Mahout is to build a vibrant, responsive, diverse community to facilitate
    discussions not only on the project itself but also on potential use cases. Come to the mailing lists to find out
    more.</p>

  <p>Currently Mahout supports mainly three use cases: Recommendation mining takes users' behavior and from that tries to
    find items users might like. Clustering takes e.g. text documents and groups them into groups of topically related
    documents. Classification learns from exisiting categorized documents what documents of a specific category look
    like and is able to assign unlabelled documents to the (hopefully) correct category.</p>

Changes in 0.9 are detailed in the [release notes](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/mahout/trunk/CHANGELOG?view=markup&pathrev=1563661").

The following algorithms that were marked deprecated in 0.8 have been removed in 0.9:

* Switched LDA implementation from Gibbs Sampling to Collapsed Variational Bayes
* Meanshift - removed due to lack of actual usage and support 
* MinHash - removed due to lack of actual usage and support 
* Winnow - removed due to lack of actual usage and support 
* Perceptron - removed due to lack of actual usage and support 
* Slope One - removed due to lack of actual usage
* Distributed Pseudo recommender - removed due to lack of actual usage
* TreeClusteringRecommender - removed due to lack of actual usage
