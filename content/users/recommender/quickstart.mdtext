Title: Recommender Quickstart

# Recommender Quickstart

It's very easy to get started with Mahout's recommenders. You don't need to know and have Hadoop for this.

Steve Cook created a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yD40rVKUwPI) on how to create a simple item-based recommender from scratch using Eclipse. (Note that you can avoid manually downloading the library jars by including mahout as [maven dependency](/general/downloads.html) into your project).
